# Nuclear.Hosting Knowledge Base

Nuclear.Hosting Knowledge Base published on https://nuclear.hosting/help is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using a theme provided by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

Feel free to update current topics or add topics you miss.

You do not need to compile files to HTML/CSS files. We do compilation on our own during deployment to the production. To edit topics or add new ones just edit appropriate files. The files are formated with [Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language).

Please keep and respect the formatting and make sure your hypertext links are work properly. 

In case of any questions check out [Nuclear.Hosting Community Board](https://community.nuclear.hosting).

We truly appreciate any help and contributions!
