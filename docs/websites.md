# Domains and Subdomains

Webhosting services are provided to a specific 2nd level domain (example.com). A third level (or subdomain) "www" domain (www.example.com) can be automatically created for this domain (by your choice in [Hosting Control Panel](https://my.nuclear.hosting) during creating a new webhosting), as an alias (example.com and www.example.com are the same web presentation).

You can create an unlimited number of other subdomains on your domain (my.example.com). Nuclear.Hosting provide **3 types of subdomains** which are sligthly different in usage.

## 1. Subdomain Vhost

### Description

A subdomain is created like a standalone webhosting but its directory is located under the main domain hosting directory structure. The primary domain will have access to this subdomain directory (eg. with PHP script).

**Subdomain Vhost features:**

 - custom folder name for subdomain
 - turn on / off custom Error pages
 - enable / disable "www" subdomain alias (www.sub.example.com)
 - custom PHP version with custom PHP settings

 - custom redirects
 - Available to both VIP and Basic memberships

**Subdomain Vhost Limitations:**

 - does not support SSL certificates (even SSL Lets Encryp't)
 - primary domain have access to subdomains data on the server (eg. within PHP script)
 - it depends / is linked with primary domain

### How to create

## 2. Subdomain Alias

### Description

It is like a regular 2nd level domain alias. This subdomain is not physicaly created, it is just an alias which can be redirected (HTTP 301 code) either to primary domain or another domain / URL. Also can be pointed to specific directory on your primary domain FTP account.

**Subdomain Alias features:**

## 3. Standalone subdomain

### Description

Standalone subdomain is like a regular webhosting for 2nd level domain. It is independent on any other domain. It is a full-featured webhosting. **Standalone subdomains are available only for VIP membership users.**

## Websites & Web Hosting

### Why we do not support caching servers (memcached, redis)

On our webservers we do not support caching servers like Memcached or Redis.

There is a big security problem with shared hosting and caching servers. Caching servers uses memory that is shared by all customers on the server. Then it is not such a problem to use the content of this shared memory to penetrate a foreign site.

Unfortunately, many shared hosting companies do not address this risk. But for us, safety comes first.

On the other side, the absence of caching servers support we have fast SSD/NVMe disks on all our servers. We are also able to connect for you a special RAM-Disk which is a dedicated piece of RAM memory connected as a regular directory (dedicated for you) where you can place your cache files. The advantage of this solution is that it's very similar to memcached or redis server where cached data are placed into RAM.

## WAF - Web Application Firewall

### What is WAF

### Known issues of incompatibilities of WAF

Some application causing False Positive results from the WAF and those kind of requests are blocked. For those applications is not possible to fix the rules which are causing False positive cases. The only solution is to turn off those rules particulary or turn off WAF for whole application (**not recommended!**). To investigate those cases contact our Support team and with co-operation we decide what is the best solution of your particular situation.

Bellow you can find well-known False positive WAF cases which we can solve easily by disabling particular WAF rules for your website. To do that, please contact our Support team.
