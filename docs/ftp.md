# FTP / SFTP, connecting to server, transfer files to server

## How to connect to FTP

!!! important
	We do not recommend to use FTP, rather use SFTP/SCP - it is much more safer.

!!! note
	SFTP/SCP is available only for VIP Membership.

File transfer to the webserver is possible via FTP or SFTP/SCP (only for VIP members). We recommend using SFTP/SCP to ensure data and password security. For connecting use any program for work with FTP or SFTP/SCP (eg FileZilla or WinSCP). To log on to the server you will need to server hostname, port, username and password.

The **server name / hostname** you can find on the Dashboard in your Hosting Control Panel account.

!!! note
	The server hostname may be different for your account than in this article. Everytime use hostname from your Dashboard.

	FTP port is always 21.

The **username and password** you can create ([How to create FTP account](#how-to-create-ftp-account)) in your Hosting Control Panel.

!!! note
	We do not officialy provide a WebFTP interface to access to FTP accounts. We recommend to use a specialized FTP/SFTP software (Filezilla, WinSCP, etc.).

### How to setup FTP client

The exact configuration depends on your chosen FTP client. In general, you need FTP username, password ([How to create FTP account](#how-to-create-ftp-account)) and server hostname. **FTP server port is 21**. Our FTP servers supports only **pasive mode**, so in your client configuration choose **pasive mode**.

!!! hint
	New FTP account is created within 5 minutes.

## How to connect to SFTP

Before you can connect to SFTP/SCP or even to use ```rsync```, you have to [create a new SFTP / SSH account](#how-to-create-sftp-scp-account) in your [Hosting Control Panel account](https://my.nuclear.hosting).

!!! note
	SFTP/SCP/SSH is available only for VIP Membership.

You will also need a **server hostname** and **port**. Server hostname you can find on your Dashboard page after logging in to Hosting Control Panel. The port can be found in the SFTP/SSH accounts overview table in Hosting Control Panel - ```Sites``` - ```Shell-User```. The credentials to your FTP and SFTP are different - they are not the same!

For proper connection you also need to use a software (client) which supports SFTP/SCP protocol. For example Filezilla or WinSCP. If you are familiar with command-line and you are a Linux or MacOS X user, you can also use CLI SSH/SFTP client.
