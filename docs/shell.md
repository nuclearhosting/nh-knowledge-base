# Shell & SSH Access

For our VIP Membership we provide access via SSH to the limited Shell enviroment. This function is dedicated especially for more advanced users whos are familiar with CLI and Linux enviroment. The goal of this service is not to offer a full-fledged root shell, but to simplify or enable some more complicated operations directly on the server.

The shell works separately for each system user. New Shell user can be created in the [Hosting Control Panel](https://my.nuclear.hosting).

!!! note
	Shell (incl. SFTP access) is available only for VIP Membership.

It is also possible to use SSH keys and it is not always necessary to enter a password when connecting. Bash running in normal mode is used as a shell, so it is possible to redirect input and output from / to a file or to pass data between commands using a pipe.
