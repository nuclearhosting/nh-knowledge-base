## How to get started - READ FIRST üôè

Is very important to realize, that **we does not provide domain names registrations**. We are closely focused only on hosting services and currently, we do not register and manage domain names for our members.

So, first of all, before you start using Nuclear.Hosting services, you need to prepare your domain name.

There are two different starting points and its solutions:

 * [You already have domain name (or more than one) registered](domains/#how-to-point-my-domain-to-nuclearhosting)
 * [You don't have domain name yet, so you need to obtain domain first](domains/#how-to-get-your-domain-name)

Now, when you have your domains ready, you can create webhosting for them.

Start by logging in to the [Hosting Control Panel](https://my.nuclear.hosting). Your credentials can be found in the email we sent you after your registration approval. You can also reset your forgotten password in the Control Panel.
