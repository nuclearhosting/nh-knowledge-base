DNS translates numerical addresses of individual devices or services into a textual form that is more digestible and memorable. For example, if you type www.google.com into the address bar of your web browser, you will be taken to the Google web. Even if you type \"173.194.65.94\" (without the quotation marks) in the address bar, you'll get exactly the same result. Of course, it is easier for people to remember the site name than its numeric address. To load a content on your domain from any server you have to point your domain name to this particular server's IP address in its DNS zone. DNS zone for domain can be created on any DNS server you have access to and which allows you to create a DNS zone for your domain.

Each domain corresponds to a series of numbers. IP addresses (eg 1.1.1.1). It is always unique, so there can not be two identical domains. We generally divide the domain into three levels. Individual levels are separated by a dot. First (TOP) Level Domain First-level domain or Top-Level Domain, abbreviated to TLD. This domain is at the end or end. after the last dot. TLD domains are divided into two types: Geographic - ccTLD Generic - gTLD Geographic ccTLD These domains are assigned to individual states. As a rule, they are in the form of an abbreviation for the country, for example, .UK for the United Kingdom, .SK for Slovakia, and so on. Generic gTLD You can register these domains completely, they are general domains that are not associated with any state. (e.g., com, org, net). New registrations are now open for new gTLD domains (such as free, blog, party, movie, live, and more). Domain of the 2nd level The 2nd level domain is a sequence of unique characters behind the national or generic domain. This domain is paid and must be registered. In this domain, only the English keyboard characters and only a small part of the ASCII characters can be used. The maximum domain length is 63 characters. There are exceptions, domains that can contain special characters called IDN (Internationalized Domain Names). These domains contain special characters as a result, but they convert to a sequence of common characters in the background. Domain of 3rd level We also call it a subdomain. The subdomain expands the second order domain. And so you can use the subdomain, you must be the 2nd order domain owner. No 3rd level domains are charged. The domain is in the form of, for example, subdomain.my-domain.com, but also www.my-domain.com.

How to create a new mailbox You can create a new mailbox in Hosting Control Panel , in Email section. Before you will be able to create a new mailbox, you have to create / setup your domain into E-Mail servers. For more details, continue here . In the left-hand menu, click on the Email Mailbox and when the mailboxes overview is loaded, click on the Add new Mailbox button. Now, you have to complete the form with all mailbox details: Name: (optional) name of your mailbox (eg. John Doe Personal) Email: this input is splitted into two parts: before (left side) and after (right side) @ sign. left side (before @ ): mailbox name (eg. johndoe) right side (after @ ): your domain name which you creating mailbox on (eg. example.com). If your domain is not listed in the select box, you have to setup it first. Read more here . The result will be: johndoe@example.com Password: put password that you will use to signing into this new mailbox. You can use your own or generate random strong password. To generate a new password, just click on the Generate Password button and than copy (save and remember) this password. Repeat password: enter the same password like one step before for verification purpose. If you used the Generate Password feature, you can skip this step - password is repeated / inserted automatically. Quota: you can setup max. size of mailbox. If you want to keep size unlimited, just enter 0 . The size is in MegaBytes (MB) unit. Send copy to: (optional) send copy of all incoming e-mails to another email address (or multiple addresses). Separate multiple email addresses with commas. Send outgoing BCC to: (optional) send copy of all incoming emails as BCC (hidden copy) to another email address (or multiple addresses). Separate multiple email addresses with commas. Spamfilter: select which antispam policy ( read more about antispam policies ) you want to apply for this mailbox. You can also disable antispam. Enable receiving: you can enable/disable incoming e-mails receiving into this mailbox. Disable SMTP (sending): you can enable/disable outgoing e-mail sending from this emailbox (outgoing SMTP). Enable greylisting: you can enable/disable Greylist protection of incoming e-mails Disable IMAP: you can enable/disable IMAP access to this mailbox Disable POP3: you can enable/disable POP3 access to this mailbox After you complete the all required fields in form, just click on the Save button. Note Changes take effect within a few minutes. All settings you made during mailbox creation can be anytime changed. How to change mailbox settings To change mailbox settings you have three options where you can do your changes: In the Hosting Control Panel by signing in with your hosting account credentials . In the Email section and then in the left-hand menu Email mailbox you can see the overview of all created mailboxes. To edit any of them, just click on the mailbox name. You can change any of the settings descibed in the How to create a new mailbox section here. By clicking on the red \"bin\" or \"trash\" button in the mailboxes overview, you delete this mailbox with all emails stored in. In the Hosting Control Panel by signing in with your email mailbox credentials . You can login in by entering mailbox name (eg. johdoe@example.com) and with password related to this mailbox. You will be able to manage all particular mailbox details (password, autoresponder, copies sending, spamfilter, e-mail filters), without access to another mailboxes on this domain or any other settings, out of the mailbox settings. You are not able to delete this mailbox or change Quota settings. In the Webmail interface by signing in with your email mailbox credentials . Navigate to Settings and Account section. Here you can change mailbox password, email forwardings, autoreply, mail filters and antispam settings. How to setup domain into Email servers To setup your domain into E-Mail servers, navigate to your Hosting Control Panel , continue to Email section, in the top menu and than click on the Domain section located in the left-hand menu. Note This step is necessary only once. After you setup your domain to e-mail system, you can create new mailboxes and other stuff without repeating this step again. To add a new domain, click on the Add new Domain button. Complete the form: Domain: Enter your domain name you want to add to e-mail system Spamfilter: Select spamfilter, if you want to protect your domain against spam Active: keep checked, otherwise you will be not able to receive and send emails from this domain (optional) DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM): You can setup DKIM signing for your domain (more information about enabling DKIM) After you completed the form, just click on the Save button. Note Changes take effect within a few minutes. Hint You can also setup your domain into E-Mail system by using Hosting Wizard tool . E-Mails forwarding All incoming e-mails you can forward to another e-mail address. In this case, the message is forwarded to the destination address immediately upon receipt. You can also redirect the mailbox to multiple addresses at once. Important We do not recommend that you set up an email address on any domain that we does not provide mailing services (such as, for example, gmail.com, yahoo.com, and so on) as the destination mailbox! Such redirection may not work properly. How to change mailbox size / quota You can define your own size / quota for every mailbox. You can set mailbox size during mailbox creating or anytime later . In addition to the size / quota of the mailbox, there is also limit for the number of messages (files) stored in one mailbox (20,000) and all mailboxes in the given domain (to 100,000). If the mailbox or domain exceed allocated quota to the size or number of files, new e-mail messages are not received and the senders receive a non-delivery report due to the recipient's full mailbox. Autoreply You can set an autoreply (Out of office message) for the mailbox, for example if you want to let the sender know about your absence (eg Holiday). The message you enter is automatically sent in response to the incoming email. Default auto-reply interval to the same sender is 30 minutes. For example, when one sender sends two messages within 10 minutes, he receives only one automatic answer. Important The allowed auto-reply interval is within 15minutes - 30days. If you setup auto-reply by mail filters (sieve), please, respect this restriction! If you setup outside range value, your auto-reply may be disabled or corrected. You can also specify a time period within you want to be your auto-reply delivered, for example from 10.01.2018 10:30 to 15.01.2018 08:00. To setup your autoreply, you have four options: In the Hosting Control Panel by signing in with your hosting account credentials . Navigate to Email section, in the left-hand menu click on the Email Mailbox , in the mailboxes overview click on mailbox you want to create auto-responder and click on tab Autoresponder . You need to fill E-Mail Subject , Text , check or uncheck Enable the autoresponder option, Start on and End by . In the Hosting Control Panel by signing in with your email mailbox credentials . After you log in with your mailbox credentials, click on the Autoresponder in the left-hand menu. You need to fill E-Mail Subject , Text , check or uncheck Enable the autoresponder option, Start on and End by . In the Webmail interface by signing in with your email mailbox credentials . Navigate to Settings and Account section. In the left-hand menu click on the Autoreply . You need to fill E-Mail Subject , Text , check or uncheck Enable the autoresponder option, Start on and End by . Email filters (Sieve filters). You can set up your autoresponder using Sieve e-mail filters directly from your e-mail client software, if it support them. Please respect auto-reply interval (see above). How to delete mailbox Delete mailbox is possible in the Hosting Control Panel , in the Email section. Click on the Email Mailbox in the left-hand menu, in the overview find mailbox you want to delete and click on the red trash button. Deleting the mailbox also deletes all messages in the mailbox and deletes the message sending access. The mailbox is also automatically removed from the settings of other mailboxes or domains in our mailing system, for which it is used as the destination for redirecting or sending copies. Additional IMAP information We have auto-delete option enabled for IMAP Trash, INBOX / Junk and Junk folders on mail storage, messages older than 30 days are removed from them automatically. These folders typically create a mail client or webmail at first login, they are used to store deleted messages or messages marked as spam. Our IMAP servers support an IDLE extension that ensures that the server immediately informs the connected client of the incoming message (ie, beyond the usual regular check intervals). Our IMAP servers support sharing of IMAP folders between different mailboxes on one domain. Our IMAP servers support quota information check. How to setup e-mail client to access my mailbox In general, you need to know Incoming server, Outgoing server (smtp) and your mailbox credentials. We recommend using e-mail clients, such as MS Outlook, Thunderbird (an e-mail program that you install on your computer / tablet / smartphone), rather than Webmail interface. Incoming server (IMAP / POP3) To set up emails receiving to a email client, you need a server address for incoming mail, username and password. IMAP / POP3 server POP3 server: mail.nuclear.hosting, port: default (110, 995 for SSL/TLS) IMAP server: mail.nuclear.hosting, port: default (143, 993 for SSL/TLS) Your username is your email address (eg johndoe@example.com - always lowercase). Outgoing server (SMTP) You can use any SMTP server, such as the SMTP server of your ISP (some providers do not allow others) to send emails. Our SMTP server SMTP server: smtp.nuclear.hosting, ports: 25 or 587 SMTP server requires authentication. Use the same credentials like for IMAP/POP3. For encrypted connection use STARTTLS. This server is for regular communication only (physical persons), not for sending bulk messages, sending messages from PHP applications (for this use PHP mail() function) or any automatic devices. The difference between POP3 and IMAP4 IMAP (Internet Messaging Access Protocol): Emails are stored on the server. Sent messages are stored on the server. Messages can be synced and accessed across multiple devices. POP3 (Post Office Protocol): Emails are stored on a single device. Sent messages are stored on a single device. Emails can only be accessed from a single device. If you want to keep messages on the server, make sure the setting \"Keep email on server\" is enabled or all messages are deleted from the server once downloaded to the app or software. Hint We recommend to using IMAP protocol. E-Mail Client Autoconfiguration / Autodiscover Our e-mail servers supports Autoconfiguration / Autodiscover feature. It allows to your e-mail client which support one of these features provide automatic configuration for them, so you don't need to enter manually POP3/IMAP server address, SMTP server addresses, ports and so on. E-Mail client based on your email address (username) you input detects appropriate settings. To use e-mail client autoconfiguration you have met two conditions: 1) Set up properly necessary DNS records: if you are using our DNS Nameservers, needed DNS records are setup automatically, when you creating DNS zone for your domain in Hosting Control Panel. If you are not using our DNS Nameservers you have to create these two DNS records (replace YOURDOMAIN.COM with your real domain name): autoconfig.YOURDOMAIN.COM. CNAME autoconfig.nuclear.hosting. _autodiscover._tcp.YOURDOMAIN.com. SRV 0 0 443 autodiscover.nuclear.hosting. 2) E-Mail client which supports autoconfiguration / autodiscover: these features are supported by Mozilla Thunderbird, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Live Mail. Apple\u00ae email clients do not support AutoConfig or AutoDiscover for IMAP servers. How to configure Mozilla Thunderbird (auto-configuration) Mozilla Thunderbird email client autoconfiguration setup instructions for receiving and sending emails. 1.

You are done! Antispam settings You can turn on antispam control for each mailbox in which incoming messages are stored (ie, which are not redirected). An incoming email that will be considered spam will be marked with ***** SPAM ***** at the beginning of the subject of the email. For example, based on this label, you can set up your email client to delete such messages, store them in a special folder, or use spam filtering directly on the server (sieve filters). We have predefined antispam policies which are described here . You can setup antispam policy for whole domain or individualy for mailboxes. Every mailbox can have different antispam policy. You can also turn off antispam filtering for any mailbox. Hint You can change antispam policy settings anytime. How to change Antispam policy or antispam settings Antispam policy changes can by done by mailbox edit. More information how to change mailbox settings (either antispam policy) follow steps described in How to change mailbox settings . DKIM & SPF DKIM DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is a solution to increase the trustworthiness of emails sent using the additional source message identification. It uses the combination of the DNS record (TXT) and the corresponding header with the DKIM signature in the sent message. Successful verification of these two factors is for the receiving SMTP server signal that the sender is unlikely to be tempted and has control over the domain from which the message is sent. DKIM setting Up Nuclear.Hosting allows you to set up DKIM signatures for all e-mail message sources. It means from PHP scripts from webservers, from outgoing SMTP server for e-mail clients (smtp.nuclear.hosting) and from webmail . 1. DKIM for messages sent from PHP / webserver Activation is automatic - when you create a new webhosting for your domain (when you add a domain to webserver in Hosting Control Panel) new DKIM signing key is generated and if you are using our DNS NameServers, appropriate DNS settings are made automatically. If you are not using our DNS Nameservers, instructions on how to set-up your DNS zone to DKIM can work correctly are sent to you by email. 2. DKIM for messages sent from outgoing SMTP server DKIM activation for outgoing SMTP server can be made in your Hosting Control Panel account when you creating / adding a new domain into e-mail servers or anytime later in domain edit. If you are adding a new domain into e-mail servers just click on the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) button. If you want to enable DKIM on already added domain, navigate to Email section in Hosting Control Panel , in the left-hand menu click on the Domain , find your domain where you want to activate DKIM, click on it and in the edit form click on the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) button. After click on the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) button the new part of the form is shown. Now check the box enable DKIM and just click on the Generate DKIM Private-key . The empty fields are automatically filled with auto-generated values. Note Do not type / write anything into DKIM Private-key field. If you are using our DNS Nameservers you don't have to do nothing more and just click on the Save button. DNS Records for DKIM will be setted up automatically. Info DNS zone changes take effect up to 24 hours. If you are not using our DNS NameServers you have to copy the content of DNS-Record field before you submit the form and add this DNS record to your domain DNS zone manually. DNS record is a TXT record. When you copied DNS record value, just click on the Save button. 3. DKIM for messages sent from webmail To enable DKIM signatures for emails sent from Webmail you just have to enable DKIM as described in step above ( 2. DKIM for messages sent from outgoing SMTP server ). No other special settings are required. SPF The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is another solution to ensure validation of an e-mail message that helps in detecting spam. Its principle is to verify the source of the sent message (the sending server) against the defined servers that are allowed to send messages from that domain. Authorized servers (their domain names or IP addresses) are listed in the SPF record in the DNS zone of that domain (SPF record is one of the types of TXT records). If the source of the message is none of the legitimate resources, the receiving SMTP server will handle the message as defined in the record and its rules (for example, the message will refuse to accept or filter it as spam). SPF checks are not performed by all receiving servers on the Internet, what they do is a minority. However, it can be assumed that their number will gradually increase. Our receiving SMTP servers do not currently perform SPF checks, however, we take SPF into account when evaluating antispam messages. SPF setting up To use SPF, you just have to for your domain to set the appropriate DNS record. It is necessary to specify all possible sources of the sent messages from the given domain and the behavior if the sending source did not meet the validation conditions. Within our Nuclear.Hosting services, messages from the domain can be sent from four different sources: webserver where is domain hosted (i.e. from PHP script) outgoing SMTP server for e-mail clients (smtp.nuclear.hosting) webmail e-mail storage server - in case you are using forwarding or copies on your mailbox (however, due to SPF and potential complications with delivery, we do not recommend to use e-mail forwardings / copies) Hint If you are using our DNS Nameservers the SPF record is created for your domain automatically. The general Nuclear.Hosting SPF record you can use, if you are not using our DNS Nameservers is: v=spf1 mx a include:spf.nuclear.hosting ~all What does this record means, you can find in the section bellow. SPF Record explanation The SPF record (TXT) consists of three parts: From the mark that this record is SPF ( v=spf1 ), the list of output sources of the messages and the conclusion specifies the behavior in the case of an unauthorized source. Several settings - mechanisms - can be used to define permitted resources. The most common are a (A or AAAA domain record), mx (MX domain record), ip4 (IPv4 address or address range), ip6 (IPv6 address or address range), ptr (reverse record) and include (retrieves another SPF record). The decision if the source fails to validate can be specified in one of four ways: + (pass), - (fail), ~ (softfail) and ? (neutral). Bellow you can find a few SPF record examples: v=spf1 ip4:1.2.3.4 ?all - only allowed sources is IP address 1.2.3.4; resolution neutral v=spf1 a mx ~all - allowed sources are IP addresses / servers, which are A, AAAA and MX records of this domain; resolution softail which means source did not pass the test but decision is not final v=spf1 ip6:2001:41d0:303:5d3b::400 a -all - allowed sources are IPv6 address 2001:41d0:303:5d3b::400 and A + AAAA records of this domain; resolution fail = source do not pass test, the message will be declined v=spf1 a:example.com ?all - allowed source is only A record of the domain example.com; resolution neutral v=spf1 a mx include:spf.nuclear.hosting ~all - allowed sources are current domain webserver (its A DNS record), domain MX server and all our servers listed in record spf.nuclear.hosting ; resolution softfail A more detailed information about SPF you can find in SPF docummentation . Antispam Policies Every incomming email message is tested by several tests to identify or even to reject junk or otherwise defective correspondence, before is being delivered into mailbox. Performing some tests depends on the recipient's mailbox settings. The following antispam tests are performed: Public Spam Blacklists Sender Domain Existence - Detects the ability to deliver a message to the sender's domain (MX or A records); if such delivery is not possible, the message is declined Delivery option to recipient's mailbox - rejects messages directed to nonexistent or out of quota mailboxes Greylisting Attachment File Extensions Antivirus Antispam Some of these tests are described below in detail. Our SMTP servers receive emails of up to about 100 MB. If for some reason the message is rejected by our servers, the client (sending server) who is trying to send the message is informed (SMTP code 5xx). It is his duty to inform the original sender of the message. Therefore, it is not possible for a message in your mailbox \"to be lost\". The sender should know about each case of non-delivery of the sent message and the reason for this non-delivery. Note The secondary / backup e-mail server ( mx2.nuclear.hosting ) is providing the same tests as well as primary e-mail server. Public Spam Blacklists Black lists (blacklists) are publicly updated lists of IP addresses of computers from which problematic mail is being sent. This is a very important tool in the fight against junk mail. If the SMTP connection is made from an IP address kept in one of the blacklists, the receiving SMTP servers are rejecting the 553 error code. We use these blacklists: zen.spamhaus.org, bl.spamcop.net, dev.null.dk, pbl.spamhaus.org, sbl.spamhaus.org, cbl.abuseat.org, dsn.rfc-ignorant.org, sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org, cbl.abuseat.org, combined.rbl.msrbl.net, rabl.nuclearelephant.com Used blacklists may change over the time. Greylisting On all our receiving SMTP servers we are using greylisting. This anti-spam method assumes that spammers' SMTP servers will not make other SMTP connections if the first connection is rejected. The first connection from an unknown sender is rejected (the email address of the sender and the IP address from which the SMTP connection was made) are taken into account. Rejection is by SMTP code that informs about temporary error (4xx) and standard SMTP server compliance standards (RFC 2821) is a signal for later attempt to deliver the message. After the first rejection of the sender, the normal connection is possible 6 minutes later, with a 24-hour interval without rejection (if more than one connection continues, this period is continuously extended). This solution may delay the reception of the message (the length of the delay depends on the SMTP server's sender settings - usually a few minutes), however, it can prevent most of the spam that goes to users' mailboxes. Hint You can easily turn off Greylisting antispam protection for any particular e-mail mailbox. Navigate to e-mail mailbox edit in your Hosting Control Panel and just uncheck Enable greylisting . Forbidden Attachment File Extensions Another check performed by the SMTP server on an incoming email is checking attachments. If the email contains an attachment file with any of these file extensions, such email will not be accepted and will be rejected. bat,chm,cmd,com,cpl,dll,exe,hlp,hta,js,pif,reg,scr,shs,vbe,vbs,vxd,wsf,wsh Outgoing SMTP server SMTP server smtp.nuclear.hosting serves (physical and real) users to send regular mail from their mail clients. Outbound messages are scanned by antivirus control and by checking the forbidden attachment terminals. Outgoing messages are also controlled by antispam. From this server, you can send an email of up to 30 MB. Important This server is not intended for sending bulk messages, automated sending (from some devices), or sending messages from web applications. The amount of messages sent per user is limited to 60 messages per hour for Basic membership and to 300 messages per hour for VIP messages (including messages sent from webmail are included), and a copy is also considered as a separate message. If the user exceeds this limit, the SMTP server will reject the next attempt to send it for the remainder of the hour with the 5xx error code. At the same time, the maximum number of recipients is limited in one message (per 100). These limits are designed to prevent undesired use of the server, which could lead to the delay of sending other users' messages. For sending messages from web applications use PHP mail() function. Troubleshooting e-mails problems Note Problems with receiving or sending mail from mail clients are most often caused by security measures on your computer or network. Typically, this is set up by firewall, antivirus, or network restrictions (for example, a ban on sending mail over SMTP servers located outside the network). If you have problems connecting to the server for incoming or outgoing mail, we recommend the following steps: Make sure your account settings are correct in your email client. For instructions on how to set up a mail client, see the Mail Client Settings . You can easily verify the login and password for your e-mail by logging in to webmail interface . Verify that the connection is not blocked by a program on your computer - a firewall or antivirus. Often, the connection blocks antivirus after it has been updated or turned on its component to control incoming emails. Verify that the connection is not blocked on your network or by your ISP. For example, some ISPs are forbidding sending messages over sending SMTP servers located outside their network. Issues with SMTP over SSL The mail client can say when sending mail: Could not connect to smtp.nuclear.hosting SMTP server using STARTTLS, since it does not offer STARTTLS in EHLO response. This problem is caused by a transparent SMTP proxy between the SMTP client and our server. For example, SMTP proxies use antiviruses on MS Windows (eg, AVG). In this case, antivirus configuration should be changed. Problem receiving and sending mail to your domain If a message fails to deliver, the sender should be informed by an error message (for example, a failure notice, delivery failure, etc.). The message may be delivered to the sender several days after sending the message (depending on the reason for the non-delivery of the message and the SMTP server sending the message). This report usually lists the reason for non-delivery. According to this information, the sender can arrange or contact the sender of the SMTP server through which he sends the mail. If the sender does not receive the message and the message does not occur, you should also contact the SMTP server administrator first. This will either solve the problem or gather the information needed for the next solution (for example, for the recipient's SMTP administrator). Sent messages are referred to as spam Inbound messages are evaluated by the recipient's mail system. The exact reason why a message is considered as unsolicited is primarily to find out there. Then you can take action and make adjustments to resolve the problem. The reasons why this happens can be many (including a combination of several different) as well as possible solutions. In general, you can increase the credibility of the sent messages by setting DKIM and SPF, but it is not a universal solution. The cause must always be addressed specifically. Restrictions of using e-mails Number of mailboxes The number of mailboxes is not limited, yet we have set the following rules to use the mailboxes for fair use: Only create boxes for your use, not for other entities and businesses Do not use mailboxes as e-mail archives; for this, it is better to use local folders on your computer Remove mailboxes that you no longer actively use (for example, you have not logged in to them for several months) Sending emails from PHP scripts From PHP, emails can be sent using PHP mail() function. Also, you can not sent via our SMTP server from PHP scripts. It is also forbidden to send via foreign SMTP servers, but if you need to send emails from PHP via foreign SMTP servers, we can set an exception for a specific domain for a specific SMTP server on request. Sending emails is limited: 60 emails in 60 minutes, 360 total per 24 hours 1800 emails in 60 minutes, 3600 total per 24 hours. If you reach this limit, the mail() function returns FALSE, so you can immediately see that the limit has been reached and you can send another batch of emails later.","title":"E-Mails"},{"location":"emails/#e-mail-services","text":"In this section you can find all topics related to e-mail services management (mailboxes, catches, forwardings, filters and more).","title":"E-Mail services"},{"location":"emails/#primary-and-secondary-incomming-server","text":"Important Primary incomming / delivery server: mx1.nuclear.hosting Secondary (backup) incomming / delivery server: mx2.nuclear.hosting","title":"Primary and Secondary incomming server"},{"location":"emails/#managing-your-mailbox","text":"","title":"Managing your Mailbox"},{"location":"emails/#how-to-access-to-mailbox","text":"There are two options, how you can access to your mailbox: Using e-mail client and IMAP / POP3 or secured IMAPs / POP3s Using web interface (webmail) Hint We would recommend you to use e-mail client, rather than webmail on daily basis to your mailbox.","title":"How to access to mailbox"},{"location":"emails/#how-to-create-a-new-mailbox","text":"You can create a new mailbox in Hosting Control Panel , in Email section.

This page will help you with the first steps of using our services. Here's how to get started, set up emails, upload your site to a server, create a database and other useful links to detailed tutorials. If you are looking for help with ordering or domain registration, please use the How To Register Domain and How to sign-up and order hosting section. Start by logging into the Control Panel . Your credentials you can find in the email we sent to you after your sign-up confirmation. You can also reset a forgotten password to the Control Panel. In the Control Panel, you set up all the hosting services. You can use the hosting services once your registration has been approved. The approval process usually takes less than 24 hours. How to launch your website For your website to work on your domain, it must be uploaded to the webserver and your domain must point to our servers ( read more ). If your site uses a database, it will be necessary to set up a database as well. Note Prefered way and our recommendation how to setup webhosting for your domain is by Hosting Wizard tool . Set up domain to webserver Before uploading your website to the server, you have to set up your domain to the webserver. In the Control Panel , navigate to \"Sites\" section and then \"Websites\" in the left-hand menu. Click on the \"Add new website\" button. You can set several different options here, such as Disk quota, Enable / Disable custom error pages, Enable / Disable SSI (Server Side Include), choose PHP version and so on. Enter your domain name and click on the \"Save\" button. Alternatively you can use Hosting Wizard tool (see bellow). Webhosting for domain will be fully created and ready within 5-10 minutes. Set up domain to DNS If you are using our DNS Nameservers, you have to create DNS Zone for your domain. Without creating DNS zone for your domain, it will be not working. To create a DNS zone file, log in to Control Panel and navigate to \"DNS\" section in the top menu. Now, click on the \"Add new DNS Zone with Wizard\" button. In \"Template\" field choose \"Webhosting\" and enter your domain name into \"Domain\" field. Now, just click on the \"Create DNS-Record\". Note Any DNS changes take up to 24 hours until release to whole Internet network, so be patient. Uploading website to the server You can upload your websites using two protocols: SFTP / SCP ( VIP Memberships only ) and FTP. For security reasons, we recommend using SFTP protocol. You will need the appropriate software to connect to the server and transfer files, for example FileZilla or WinSCP. Note We do not offer WebFTP interface due the outdated and not longer developed software providing WebFTP interface. Setting up connection and upload of your site's files to the server: To connect to a server, you will need host to connect (server name), username and password. Go to the Control Panel to \"Sites\" section and then to the \"FTP-Accounts\" section in the left-hand menu. Here you can create your username and set password. The host (server name) you can find on the dashboard in Control Panel. FTP Account will be fully created and ready to use within 5-10 minutes. Once you have connected to the server, you will see several directories (read more about Directory structure ), the directory where you need to place your presentation files is named \"web\". Go to that directory and upload the necessary files to it. As first, after the domain name is entered into the Internet browser, the startup file will be loaded, which must carry a specific name (such as index.html). For more information about FTP, SFTP/SSH and how to create a FTP account click here . If you want to install a Wordpress to your domain, you can use our 1-Click Installer and install a new Wordpress by a few clicks! Read more about Wordpress 1-Click Installer . Databases In addition to file databases, we offer the use of MySQL database systems. For more information about working with it, see MySQL section . How to create an email box and use it In order to use an email box on your domain, you must first create it and also set up this domain to our email servers. In the Control Panel , in the \"Email\" section and then \"Domains\" section in the left menu, you can set up your domain into e-mail servers, by clicking on the \"Add new Domain\" button. Create a mailbox in the Control Panel under \"Email\" and \"E-Mail Mailbox\" in the left menu. When setting up a mailbox, you set the password to access it, and you can also set up additional mailbox services (redirection, antispam, etc.). Note You can also use the Hosting Wizard tool section in Control Panel, which can be used to create both web hosting and mailboxes in one step (see bellow). For more information about setting up an email box and selecting options, see Manage mailbox . The mailbox can be accessed from any mail client using POP3 or IMAP protocols. Alternatively, it is possible to work with the mail from the web interface (webmail) , but we recommend it only as an additional solution. How to configure e-mail client Basic Mail Client Settings: To set up receiving emails in your email client you need to know incoming mail server, username and password. The name of the incoming mail server (POP3 and IMAP) is mail.nuclear.hosting , Username is your full mailbox name ( name@domain.com ) and password is you set up while creating your mailbox in Control Panel. For outgoing emails you do not necessarily need to use our sending SMTP server. This may not even be possible, if your ISP does not allow it. To set up our outgoing SMTP server you need to: outgoing mail server name: smtp.nuclear.hosting . SMTP server requires a login. use the same username and password as for receiving mail. How to create webhosting using Hosting Wizard Hosting Wizard is tool in Control Panel which allows you to create full webhosting for your domain. In one single step you can create website hosting, set disk quotas, choose PHP version, create DNS zone with all DNS records, e-mail mailboxes, MySQL database, FTP account,set up DKIM and much more. To use Hosting Wizard login to your Control Panel account and click on \"Create webhosting\" button located in top menu. By using a Hosting Wizard you can also install a Wordpress to your domain. Just check the Install Wordpress field and Create DB as well. How to preview and test your website before DNS change You can preview and test your website on Nuclear.Hosting before you change your DNS settings. All you have to do is change resolving domain names to IP addresses locally on your computer. Configuration depends on your operating system. First you need to find out what is your servers IP address. Log in to your Hosting Control Panel and in the Dashboard view you will find your webserver IP address. Locate and edit the hosts file on your computer. Its location depends on your operating system. The following are common locations for this file: Microsoft Windows: c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts Linux, BSD, Android etc.: /etc/hosts Mac OS X: /private/etc/hosts You have to edit hosts file as Administrator - with admin rights/permissions. Put into hosts file content like follow: 1.2.3.4 example.com www.example.com where 1.2.3.4 is your webserver IP address you find in your Hosting Control Panel (like described on point 1.) and where example.com is, put your domain name you want to test from your new hosting.

A third level (or subdomain) \"www\" domain (www.example.com) can be automatically created for this domain (by your choice in Hosting Control Panel during creating a new webhosting), as an alias (example.com and www.example.com are the same web presentation). You can create an unlimited number of other subdomains on your domain (my.example.com). Nuclear.Hosting provide 3 types of subdomains which are sligthly different in usage. 1. Subdomain Vhost Description A subdomain is created like a standalone webhosting but its directory is located under the main domain hosting directory structure. The primary domain will have access to this subdomain directory (eg. with PHP script). Subdomain Vhost features: custom folder name for subdomain turn on / off custom Error pages enable / disable \"www\" subdomain alias (www.sub.example.com) custom PHP version with custom PHP settings custom password protected AWStats statistics custom redirects Available for both VIP and Basic memberships Subdomain Vhost Limitations: primary domain have access to subdomains data on the server (eg. within PHP script) is linked with primary domain How to create In the Hosting Control Panel navigate to Sites section and in the left-hand menu click on the Subdomain (Vhost) . To create a new subdomain click on the green Add new subdomain . 2. Subdomain Alias Description It is like a regular 2nd level domain alias. This subdomain is not physicaly created, it is just an alias which can be redirected (HTTP 301 code) either to primary domain or another domain / URL. Also can be pointed to specific directory on your primary domain FTP account. Subdomain Alias features: it is like an alias / virtual alias can be redirected to another domain (HTTP 301) can be redirected / routed to specific directory on the primary domain different redirection types (by mod_rewrite) like: no flag, R, L, R+L, R=301+L Let's Encrypt SSL Support (optinaly can be turned off for specific subdomain) Available for both VIP and Basic memberships Subdomain Alias limitations: is linked with primary domain primary domain have access to subdomains data on the server (eg. within PHP script) no individual PHP settings or PHP versions (the same PHP version and configuration is applied like on primary domain) How to create In the Hosting Control Panel navigate to Sites section and in the left-hand menu click on the Subdomain for website . To create a new subdomain click on the green Add new Subdomain . 3. Standalone subdomain Description Standalone subdomain is like a regular webhosting for 2nd level domain. It is independent on any other domain. It is a full-featured webhosting. Standalone subdomains are available only for VIP membership users. Standalone subdomain features: standalone and full-features webhosting with all features indenpedent of any other domain Let's Encrypt SSL support custom PHP version & configuration custom / dedicated FTP enviroment (no shared with any domain) and all regular webhosting benefits and features Standalone subdomain limitations: no shared files / data / folders with primary or any other domain you need a free hosting slot availbe to create a standalone subdomain (within max. domains limits of your account) How to create The procedure is the same like when you creating a webhosting for a new 2nd level domain. In the Hosting Control Panel navigate to Sites section and in the left-hand menu click on the Website . To create a new subdomain click on the green Add new website .

It allows to display one web site under several domain names. Alias can be configured in your Hosting Control Panel , under Sites section and then in the left-hand menu click on the Aliasdomain for website . How to configure new domain alias There is several way how to configure domain aliases with several different options regarding usage and behaviour you are expecting. The same web presentations on different domains You will use this option if you own different domains and you want everyone to have the same website. Another use-case is when you have a domain pointed to another web hosting, you plan to transfer this domain to Nuclear.Hosting but with a newer website or newer content - you can dev a new version on hosting created on NH, on the original domain name without changing DNS record and just use an alias domain (or alias subdomain) to build a new version of the website and after that, you simply change DNS record of that domain. Example: You have two domain names: example1.com and example2.com . A domain example1.com has created a web hosting with website uploaded and is considered as main domain. The same content you want to see on the example2.com without creating an another standalone hosting and duplicating all website files to there, which is unnecessary. To achieve desired behaviour you need to configure example2.com as alias for example1.com and change a coresponding DNS record for example2.com (point domain to our servers). To configure such domain alias, navigate to your Hosting Control Panel , Sites and Aliasdomain for website , click on the Add new Aliasdomain . Complete the form as described bellow: Domain enter your alias domain name Parent website is a target (website to show when you enter alias domain name) for your alias Redirect Type keep unchanged ( No redirect ) Redirect path keep empty Auto-Subdomain change value when you want to use wildcard-domain within your alias (*.youralias.tld) or www subdomain (www.youralias.tld) or just simple (none value) original alias domain name (name you entered into Domain field) Now just click on the Save button. Note Do not forget to configure DNS zone of your alias domain and point to NH servers. The procedure is the same as for poiting domain for a regular hosting, described here . Different web presentations on different domains on one hosting FIXME: Toto nejde ako na CH, musi sa to nasmerovat do zlozky v \"Cesta presmerovani\" Thanks to aliases, you can run several different web presentations on different domains on one hosting. This solution is suitable in a situation where creating or purchasing standalone hosting for a given domain name would be unnecessary. In this case you can point your alias domain to existing subdomain on already hosted domain. Example: You have hosting created for a domain example.com and another domains mydomain.net and yourdomain.org where you want to create a simple websites without creating a new standalone hosting accounts for them. To do this, you need to create an two folders on example.com FTP space, let say mydomain and yourdomain in the main /web folder. Upload your websites to those folders. Configure domain mydomain.net as an alias for example.com and configure Redirect Path to folder /mydomain/ and repeat the same for yourdomain.org but enter /yourdomain/ to Redirect Path . Configure necessary DNS records. Now when you enter mydomain.net content from example.com/mydomain will be loaded and when you enter yourdomain.org , content from example.com/yourdomain will appear. To configure this type of domain alias navigate to your Hosting Control Panel , Sites and Aliasdomain for website , click on the Add new Aliasdomain . Complete the form as described bellow: Domain enter your alias domain name Parent website is a target (website to show when you enter alias domain name) for your alias Redirect Type keep unchanged ( No redirect ) or choose L Redirect path enter folder name where website for this alias domain will be uploaded Auto-Subdomain change value when you want to use wildcard-domain within your alias (*.youralias.tld) or www subdomain (www.youralias.tld) or just simple (none value) original alias domain name (name you entered into Domain field) Now just click on the Save button. Note Do not forget to configure DNS zone of your alias domain and point to NH servers. The procedure is the same as for poiting domain for a regular hosting, described here . Websites & Web Hosting Why we do not support caching servers (memcached, redis) On our webservers we do not support caching servers like Memcached or Redis. There is a big security problem with shared hosting and caching servers. Caching servers uses memory that is shared by all customers on the server. Then it is not such a problem to use the content of this shared memory to penetrate a foreign site. Unfortunately, many shared hosting companies do not address this risk. But for us, safety comes first. On the other side, the absence of caching servers support we have fast SSD/NVMe disks on all our servers. We are also able to connect for you a special RAM-Disk which is a dedicated piece of RAM memory connected as a regular directory (dedicated for you) where you can place your cache files. The advantage of this solution is that it's very similar to memcached or redis server where cached data are placed into RAM. WAF - Web Application Firewall What is WAF A web application firewall (WAF) is an application firewall for HTTP applications. It applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks stemming from web application security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and security misconfigurations. On our servers we are using ModSecurity as WAF. Known issues of incompatibilities of WAF Some application causing False Positive results from the WAF and those kind of requests are blocked. For those applications is not possible to fix the rules which are causing False positive cases. The only solution is to turn off those rules particulary or turn off WAF for whole application ( not recommended! ). To investigate those cases contact our Support team and with co-operation we decide what is the best solution of your particular situation. Bellow you can find well-known False positive WAF cases which we can solve easily by disabling particular WAF rules for your website. To do that, please contact our Support team. Well-known False positive WAF issues: Divi Builder for Wordpress TTFB - Time To First Byte Time to first byte (TTFB) is a measurement used as an indication of the responsiveness of a webserver or other network resource. TTFB measures the duration from the user or client making an HTTP request to the first byte of the page being received by the client's browser. Time to first byte is an element of site speed, but a low TTFB on its own is not enough to make a site fast. For example, if a site has a low TTFB but lots of images, ads, javascript files, connecting to external resources (3rd party APIs) then it will still take a long time for the site to load fully. There are three main components to TTFB: Request: When a web browser goes to a website, it sends an http request which gets routed and travels to eventually reach the server that hosts the site. Server processing: The server receives the request, pass it to your web application , your website processes it and sends back response. Response: The response from the server gets routed and travels back to the web browser. TTFB is the time it takes for the first piece of the response to reach the web browser. The location of your visitors is a big factor because the request has to travel from the visitor\u2019s computer to the server, and then the response has to travel all the way back. For a website hosted in the US, a visitor from a US city might get a TTFB under 200 milliseconds, while a visitor from Europe could get a TTFB of 1 second or more. Tip Do you know that with our VIP Membership you can host your websites in the USA and Europe location? Its only up to you where you place your websites. The speed of the visitor\u2019s internet is also important. A slow connection with a bad signal could have a much higher TTFB. One of the most important elements in the TTFB is your website / your web application. The actual response to clients request is generated by your application. Webserver pass clients request to your application (either HTML or PHP). Your application process the request (for example by executing PHP code) and return some output which webserver send back to the client's browser. If your application is slow, executing of your PHP code is slower, not efficient enough, consumes too much server resources, handling a lot of data (from MySQL database or 3rd party services), the request processing will be longer and TTFB will rise essentially. How to measure TTFB There are several free tools you can use to measure your website\u2019s TTFB. 1. KeyCDN Tool This free tool from KeyCDN tests your website\u2019s TTFB from 14 different locations around the world. The difference in TTFB measured is mostly due to the distance from the testing locations to the web server. 2. WebPageTest WebPageTest has a very detailed speed test tool that gives you a lot of data, including a detailed waterfall chart that shows all the different files that load. It also gives you a result for TTFB, both an exact number and a letter grade. 3. PageSpeed Insights TTFB is also a component of Google\u2019s PageSpeed Insights test tool. If it is high, the tool gives you a warning and lowers your score. 4. Google Chrome DevTools / Firefox DevTools You can measure TTFB in Google Chrome / Firefox by launching DevTools. Remember, if you are testing from your computer that TTFB is affected by network latency and your internet connection. Notice Those 3rd party tools are not perfect and results from them are not 100% reliable and guaranteed. Use them with wisdom, as clues rather than mandatory. The results may differs rapidly from test by test and tool by tool. How to improve your TTFB Regarding to our previous explanation of TTFB, there is a several steps you can do to improve your TTFB. 1. Optimize your web application This is a first and mandatory step to significantly improve your TTFB. What does it mean in particular? analyse your SQL queries, slow queries, simplifie them analyse content in SQL tables, check if you are using indexes, remove old or unnecessary content from SQL tables analyse if your website is connecting to any 3rd party websites or APIs, check how long this connection takes, consider not to call this resource online rather than in CRON or if you have to call them, configure lowest possible timeout for this connection prevent loading a big images, a lot of CSS or JS files, move them to end of the page loading if possible use PHP profiller tool to investigate bottlenecks in your app or NewRelic tool consider to use caching (caching plugin if you are using CMS) to cache and serve static content and/or SQL queries 2. Keep your server as close to your users as possible The distance from the web server is one of the most important determinants of TTFB. If the majority of your users come from the US, then your site should be hosted in the US. If it\u2019s a UK-specific website, then it should be hosted in the UK or Europe in general. Tip Do you know that with our VIP Membership you can host your websites in the USA and Europe location? Its only up to you where you place your websites. 3. Use a content delivery network (CDN) CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. By using a CDN for your website, you can cache static files like images, css files and javascript files on servers that are close to your visitors. A CDN can speed up your site by serving these static files to your visitors much faster. It does not lower the TTFB of your initial html page file, but it does significantly lower the TTFB of the static files. Popular CDN network are CloudFlare or OVH CDN. Tip If you are interested in about CDN usage, contact us! We can offer you usage of our CDN network with nodes (19 nodes) all over the world. 4. Switch to a faster web host If your web server is poorly configured or not powerful enough to deliver a speedy response to the visitor, then your TTFB will be high. Note This option should be considered either as first or as the last option in your journey to lower TTFB. It really depends on many factors. If your app is not working fast enough even on the fastest server/web host you will have poor TTFB. When it comes to web hosting, you really do get what you pay for. A cheap web hosting provider may be holding your site back and preventing it from reaching its full potential Tip Do you know that we in Nuclear.Hosting are using the fastest NVMe SSD drive, we strictly limit the number of websites on every webserver and before every webserver is placed a caching proxy server? This prevents to servers overload (and increasing TTFB) when hundreds or even thousands websites are placed on the one server (to save web host costs which is very common), speed-up and lower disk I/O and serve content much faster.

TTFB measures the duration from the user or client making an HTTP request to the first byte of the page being received by the client's browser. Time to first byte is an element of site speed, but a low TTFB on its own is not enough to make a site fast. For example, if a site has a low TTFB but lots of images, ads, javascript files, connecting to external resources (3rd party APIs) then it will still take a long time for the site to load fully. There are three main components to TTFB: Request: When a web browser goes to a website, it sends an http request which gets routed and travels to eventually reach the server that hosts the site. Server processing: The server receives the request, pass it to your web application , your website processes it and sends back response. Response: The response from the server gets routed and travels back to the web browser. TTFB is the time it takes for the first piece of the response to reach the web browser. The location of your visitors is a big factor because the request has to travel from the visitor\u2019s computer to the server, and then the response has to travel all the way back. For a website hosted in the US, a visitor from a US city might get a TTFB under 200 milliseconds, while a visitor from Europe could get a TTFB of 1 second or more. Tip Do you know that with our VIP Membership you can host your websites in the USA and Europe location? Its only up to you where you place your websites. The speed of the visitor\u2019s internet is also important. A slow connection with a bad signal could have a much higher TTFB. One of the most important elements in the TTFB is your website / your web application. The actual response to clients request is generated by your application. Webserver pass clients request to your application (either HTML or PHP). Your application process the request (for example by executing PHP code) and return some output which webserver send back to the client's browser. If your application is slow, executing of your PHP code is slower, not efficient enough, consumes too much server resources, handling a lot of data (from MySQL database or 3rd party services), the request processing will be longer and TTFB will rise essentially.","title":"TTFB - Time To First Byte"},{"location":"websites/#how-to-measure-ttfb","text":"There are several free tools you can use to measure your website\u2019s TTFB. 1.

WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time. Installing Wordpress by 1-Click Installer Installing a Wordpress to your domain on Nuclear.Hosting is such easy! You can install a new Wordpress directly from your Hosting Control Panel account by one click! All installation is completed automatically and your Wordpress is ready tu use within minute. To install Wordpress using 1-Click Installer log in to your Hosting Control Panel account and click on the 1-Click Apps located on the top menu. Continue by clicking on Install Wordpress in the left-hand menu. Now, choose a domain where you want to install Wordpress to. You can also specify a sub-directory (eg. yourdomain.tld/my-wordpress). If you do not want to install Wordpress into sub-directory, leave the Sub-directory field empty. Enter your admin username, your admin e-mail address (e-mail must be existing and working - to this address you will receive admin credentials to Wordpress admin panel) and choose a Wordpress language. Now just click on the Save button. Note We recommend to install wordpress to empty folder. The existing data will be automatically backed-up. Note Installation can take a few minutes - usually it's about two minutes. Login credentials to your Wordpress admin will be sent to e-mail address you entered. Delete Wordpress installation from 1-Click Installer If you want to remove previous Wordpress installation made by 1-Click Installer, just click on the red bin button in the list of installed 1-Click apps. All data (FTP, MySQL) will be permanently deleted. WP-CLI: How to use wp-cli to manage Wordpress from cli WP-CLI is a terminal interface through which you can work with WordPress directly via the terminal and SSH connection. You can, for example, download installation files, install plugin, and perform advanced edits over multiple sites at once. Using WP-CLI you can manage your whole Wordpress website from shell console, with super-admin privileges. It saves your time and allows you to automatise some processes or help managing a bigger Wordpress websites and installations. WP-CLI support is available on our VIP hosting. All you need is active SSH access. WP-CLI Usage Examples Install files download (Wordpress package download) $ cd /web $ wp core download --path=dev/wp-cli Creating directory '/home/sourcecode.sk/sub/dev/wp-cli/'. Downloading WordPress 4.9.8 (en_US)... Using cached file '/home/.wp-cli/cache/core/wordpress-4.9.8-en_US.tar.gz'... Success: WordPress downloaded. With the \"wp core download\" command, you download the installation files to the folder you are currently in. In the example above, we've set --path=dev/wp-cli to set the files to the dev/wp-cli folder in main web folder. Creating a new wp-config.php file Hint Before you start creating a wp-config file, create a new MySQL Database with a new database user first. $ cd /web/dev/wp-cli $ wp config create --dbname=wpclidemo --dbuser=wpclidemuser --dbpass=password --dbhost=mysql5-1 Success: Generated 'wp-config.php' file. Entering the \"wp config create\" command you create a new wp-config.php file with your database data settings. At this point, it is worth mentioning that the \"wp db create\" command will no longer work because of the nature of our web / DB servers - you can not create a new database using WP-CLI. However, you can work in the local environment. Note Creation of MySQL database and database user is available only in Hosting Control Panel . Installing Wordpress with database migration When you have downloaded Wordpress files, created a configuration file (wp-config.php), you can run Wordpress installation process. In the directory where you have downloaded Wordpress and created wp-config.php file, just run (do not forget to adjust CAPS variables by your needs): $ wp core install --url=\"ENTER_URL\" --title=\"ENTER_WEBSITE_TITLE\" --admin_user=\"ENTER_ADMIN_USERNAME\" --admin_email=\"ENTER_ADMIN_EMAIL\" Hint When process is completed, do not forget to copy auto-generated admin password. Plugins update With the \"wp plugin update --all\" command, you will instantly update all installed WordPress plugins in that folder. In the example below, you can also see the form of the output. You surely noticed that no WordPress password was needed - if you are connected via SSH, with WP-CLI you have full control over everything. The command above update all you plugins, but you can update them selectively: $ wp plugin update PLUGIN_NAME Where PLUGIN_NAME is name of the plugin you want to update. Themes update To update all your installed themes just enter in the Wordpress directory: $ wp theme update --all You can also update themes selectively: $ wp theme update THEME_NAME Where THEME_NAME is name of the theme you want to update. Wordpress update Updating Wordpress installation is also very easy. You can update whole Wordpress installation by command. In the Wordpress directory run: $ wp core update Disable WP-CRON To disable internal Wordpress CRON execution (read more bellow) using WP-CLI utility run: $ wp config set DISABLE_WP_CRON true More useful WP-CLI commands To list of all WP-CLI useful features please visit WP-CLI Guide (link bellow), or you can use WP-CLI Help by entering: $ wp help We consider these functions to be very useful: wp comment - Creates, updates, deletes, and moderates comments. wp core - Downloads, installs, updates, and manages a WordPress installation. wp cron - Tests, runs, and deletes WP-Cron events; manages WP-Cron schedules. wp export - Exports WordPress content to a WXR file. wp import - Imports content from a given WXR file. wp media - Imports files as attachments, regenerates thumbnails, or lists registered image sizes. wp option - Retrieves and sets site options, including plugin and WordPress settings. wp plugin - Manages plugins, including installs, activations, and updates wp post - Manages posts, content, and meta. wp role - Manages user roles, including creating new roles and resetting to defaults. wp site - Creates, deletes, empties, moderates, and lists one or more sites on a multisite installation. wp super-admin - Lists, adds, or removes super admin users on a multisite installation. wp theme - Manages themes, including installs, activations, and updates. wp user - Manages users, along with their roles, capabilities, and meta. More WP-CLI options A WP-CLI guide is available on wordpress.org, look for recommendations or a list of all commands . WP-CRON WordPress uses its own WP-Cron mechanism to run various regular maintenance tasks. The whole functionality is provided by the wp-cron.php script, which runs by default every time you visit the site. However, this solution has major disadvantages. Given a large number of requests from site visitors (including robots), this script runs with unnecessary server load. In addition, it is called like an external webserver request that occupies another PHP process, the maximum number of which is limited for each domain. Both can have a significant negative impact on the application's response, as well as server load. For these reasons, we recommend you to turn off the default WP-Cron method and call wp-cron.php by using our system cron function. To disable the default wp-cron method, insert the following line at the end of the wp-config.php file: define ('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true); or use WP-CLI as described above. Now, you have to setup system cron to regularly call wp-cron.php script on your website. Log-in to your Hosting Control Panel , go to Sites and in the left-hand menu click on Cron Jobs and then Add new Cron job . Fill the form like picture shows. In the Parent Website field choose your domain where you want to configure cron. Into Minutes field put a random minute value between range 0 - 59. In the Command to run field replace example.com by your domain name. Finish setup by clicking on the Save button. Wordpress Speed Optimization Tips Is your wordpress website slow and response time takes so so long? Read how to speed-up your wordpress website \ud83e\udd13 What slow down your Wordpress website? Learning what slows down your website is the key to improving performance and making smarter long-term decisions. The primary causes for a slow WordPress website are: Web Hosting: When your web hosting server is not properly configured, overloaded or does not use SSD or NVMe drives, it can affect your website speed WordPress Configuration: If your WordPress site is not serving cached pages, or is not configured properly, then it will overload your server thus causing your website to be slow Page Size: Mainly images that aren\u2019t optimized for web Bad Plugins: If you\u2019re using a poorly coded plugin, too many plugins or poorly coded themes, then it can significantly slow down your website External scripts: External scripts such as ads, font loaders, etc can also have a huge impact on your website performance How to measure your Wordpress speed The usual way how to measure your website speed is by using specialized external services. It is a good starting point but the result is not a holy grail. Every time when you use external service to measure your site speed, you have to always keep in mind, that you are using an external service where you do not know how they are providing measurements, how loaded are servers where these measurements are provided and the distance between external measurement servers and your website/server. The difference in real loading time of your website and the time from measurement result may differ rapidly. Also, keep in mind that those tools does give you information about total load time and some more deeper information about page elements but does not give you detailed information about problematic plugins or problematic themes on your website (slow PHP, PHP bottlenecks, etc). So, what are the most common online services to test your website speed? Pingdom Tools - Pingdom Tools rates your site based on several metrics. For instance, it shows how many requests were required, how many redirects were performed, and how your site\u2019s speed compares to others. Since the results will differ slightly each time, you\u2019ll want to do this a few times to get an average figure. GTMetrix - GTMetrix works much the same way as the previous tool, but it also provides more in-depth metrics and even offers optimization suggestions based on your results. Remember to run this test a few times as well to get a reliable average result. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll have a solid idea of how well your site is currently performing. WebPageTest - The most detailed tool and in-depth metrics from the previous two. You can choose from many locations from where to proceed with your tests. You can find many important pieces of information in results. Google PageSpeed Insights - Provides you with detailed metrics for both mobile page view and desktop page view. You can find some additional information to help you optimize your website in addition to previous tools. How to speed-up your Wordpress Always Keep Your WordPress Updated Important Keeping your Wordpress, themes and plugins updated is essential number on rule! As a well maintained open source project, WordPress is updated frequently. Each update will not only offer new features but it will also fix security issues and bugs. Your WordPress theme and plugins may have regular updates, too. As a website owner, it\u2019s your responsibility to keep your WordPress site, theme, and plugins updated to the latest versions. Not doing so may make your site slow and unreliable, and make you vulnerable to security threats. In addition to security fixes, the newly released versions can also solve bugs that cause a decrease in the performance of your application, or excessive utilization of server resources. Therefore, our recommendation is either to turn on automatic updates or, if this setting is not possible due to individual adjustments in your application, a regular manual update. For plugins that are marked as obsolete by the developers and are no longer patched, we recommend that you completely uninstall these plugins and, if necessary, select an alternative with the same or similar functionality for them. Optimize Background Processes Background processes in WordPress are scheduled tasks that run in the background of your WordPress site. Following are some examples of background tasks that run on a WordPress site: WordPress Backup plugin tasks WordPress cron jobs to publish scheduled posts WordPress cron jobs to check for updates Search engines and other crawlers trying to fetch content Tasks like cron jobs for scheduled posts and updates have minimal impact on website performance. However, other background processes like backup plugins and excessive crawling by search engines can slow down a website. As for crawling, you need to keep an eye on your crawl reports in Google Search console. Frequent crawls that are ending up in errors can cause your website to slow down or become unresponsive. The problem is that the default mechanism for running these tasks is very unfortunate in WordPress, especially with regard to creating unnecessary load on the server. To run these tasks, it uses the wp-cron.php script, which is run every time a page is requested/loaded, and therefore usually unnecessarily. Such a mechanism causes more significant problems, especially for presentations with higher attendance. Fortunately, this not entirely ideal behavior on our servers can be easily bypassed. All you have to do in WordPress is to disable such cron execution and instead run the wp-cron.php script only at defined times using our cron ( more information ). Implement Server Side Caching to Reduce Server Resources Usage Every webpage visited on your WordPress site requires a request to the server, processing by that server (including database queries), and then a final result sent from the server to the user\u2019s browser. The result is your website, complete with all of the files and elements that make it look the way it does. For instance, you might have a header, images, a menu, and a blog. Since the server has to process all of those requests, it takes some time for the complete webpage to be delivered to the user\u2013especially with clunky or larger websites. That\u2019s where a WordPress caching plugins comes into play. Caching instructs the server to store some files to disk or RAM, depending on the configuration. Therefore, it can remember and duplicate the same content it\u2019s been serving in the past. Basically, it reduces the amount of work required to generate a page view. As a result, your web pages load much faster, directly from cache. Caching dynamically generated content (typically HTML) from server-side applications can significantly improve page load speed, but in some cases can lead to performance degradation and slow response. There are a number of caching plugins for WordPress, but only some are generally a good choice for all cases. Whenever possible, we recommend that you prefer caching to memory over caches that store the generated data in disk files. Compared to disk caches, memory caches are much faster in terms of writing and reading data. A typical example is a memcached server. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to run a memcached server on shared web hosting servers. More information can be found here . It is therefore possible to use one of the plugins that implement the disk cache. However, its use must be carefully considered, it is not suitable, for example, with a large number of accesses to a large number of different pages, intensive crawling of pages by robots and / or in the case of rapidly changing content over time. In such cases, the overhead for cache management is greater than its advantages in providing pre-generated content and then generates such a large number of disk operations on the server that in addition to significantly slowing down the response of the application itself can cause server overload and affect other applications (in the case of shared services and other users). Therefore, if you decide to activate the disk cache, we recommend that you immediately check how turning it on will affect the loading speed of the various pages of the presentation. We also offer an individual RAMDISK service, which can be used as an alternative between mecached and disk cache. This service allows a fixed allocation of parts of the server's RAM and connect it as a folder in the space of your domain in which you can store cache files. In this case, the files will be physically located in RAM, but you can work with them and access them as if they were stored on disk. If you are interested in such a service, contact our technical support. To enable Wordpress caching, we would recommend these plugins: W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache . Use Image Optimization to Make Your Media Files Smaller One of the biggest drains on your site\u2019s resources is its images. They\u2019re great for making your site look amazing and for supplementing your text content, but they also require server space and bandwidth. This is especially true if your site contains high-quality images, such as in a portfolio, gallery, or online store. Image optimization is a process that compresses the size of an image file without noticeably affecting its quality. This is easy to implement, and you can even automate the process entirely. The first method you can use is to optimize your images before you even upload them to your site. We recommend TinyPNG or Squoosh.app because they are free and very easy to use. There are also numerous plugins that enable you to optimize images automatically when you upload them to your WordPress site. One of the favorite is ShortPixel or WP Smush . Use a Content Delivery Network While communication is becoming more and more digitized, physical distance is still a factor when it comes to sending information online. Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) can help you create a consistent and faster experience for visitors, regardless of their geographic location. A CDN refers to a network of proxy servers that are spread across the world. Each server contains \"static\" files used to make up your website, which can be used to deliver your static content more quickly to users all over the globe. Not only will this improve your site\u2019s speed, but it will also increase its security. The easiest way to use a CDN with WordPress is to install a plugin. We recommend Cloudflare , which protects and accelerates your site with minimal configuration required. Clean Up Your Media Library and Post Revisions It\u2019s not just plugins and themes that can build up over time and clog up your site. As your site grows, your media library will fill up with images, documents, and other files. It\u2019s not unusual for long-running sites to contain hundreds if not thousands of image files, for example. Even if you use image optimization, this many files can start to strain your server resources. A fair amount of these files might not even be used anymore. There are plugins that can help you out to identify and remove them. In this case, we recommend Media Cleaner plugin. This plugin will automatically find and delete any unused media files in your library. It will search for files that don\u2019t appear on any pages or posts and place them in a trash. Another potential resource-waster is post revisions. Post revisions take up space in your WordPress database. Some users believe that revisions can also affect some database queries run by plugins. If the plugin doesn\u2019t specifically exclude post revisions, it might slow down your site by searching through them unnecessarily. You can easily limit the number of revisions WordPress keeps for each article. Simply add this line of code to your wp-config.php file: define( 'WP_POST_REVISIONS', 4 ); This code will limit WordPress to only save your last 4 revisions of each post or page, and discard older revisions automatically. Note If you use our 1-Click Wordpress Installer, this setting is already implemented. Anyway, you can change or remove it anytime. Use Faster Plugins and Delete Unused Themes, Plugins Poorly coded WordPress plugins often load too much bloat whether your site needs it or not. This increases your page load speed and slows down your site. Each activated plugin is involved in the generation of the page, so a large number of plugins can significantly extend the loading time, even if none of the used plugins is significantly demanding. Therefore, we recommend that you carefully select only those plugins that are necessary for the required functionality of the application. If you are no longer sure that you or visitors to your site will use it during normal operation when installing the plugin, do not install the plugin or at least deactivate it. For most additional functionality, there are several alternative plugins for WordPress, but of different qualities. Therefore, we recommend that you carefully select the plugin that does not cause known issues, whether performance or otherwise. For initial inspiration, we recommend looking for a rating resp. comparison of considered plugins on specialized sites. We recommend that you always choose the plugin that only does exactly what you are installing it for. There are also complex plugins that add a large number of functions to WordPress, but you will really only use a few (or just one) of them. However, due to their complexity, these plugins can be more computationally intensive and thus again cause various performance problems. The principle, therefore, is to choose a one-sided plugin for a specific activity that best handles this thing precisely and only. Even with appropriately selected and tested plugins, it may happen that their default settings are not optimal from the performance point of view, or their settings contain options that can significantly degrade performance. Therefore, for each plugin, we recommend that you carefully consider the best settings according to the documentation and test each setting change carefully. Improperly chosen theme can significantly negatively affect the speed of loading pages, both due to the load created on the server and due to the large number of elements that need to be loaded and downloaded from the server to render the page in the visitor's browser and also due to downloading data from other external servers. When choosing a theme, we therefore recommend, in addition to a nice graphic design and a richness of functions, also emphasis on the speed of its loading, again with thorough testing. This applies both to freely downloadable themes and to those created by an external supplier. Reduce External HTTP Requests Many WordPress plugins and themes load all kinds of files from other websites. These files can include scripts, stylesheets, and images from external resources like Google, Facebook, analytics services, and so on. It\u2019s ok to use a few of these. Many of these files are optimized to load as quickly as possible, so it\u2019s faster than hosting them on your own website. But if your plugins are making a lot of these requests, then it could slow down your website significantly. You can reduce all these external HTTP requests by disabling scripts and styles or merging them into one file. Another problem are calls to different 3rd party API services or any other external resources which your theme or plugins depend on when processing PHP its codes. If such 3rd service or API is unavailable, your website may slow down rapidly or even may cause complete website downtime. Reduce Database Calls Unfortunately, there are a lot of poorly coded WordPress themes out there. They ignore WordPress standard practices and end up making direct database calls, or too many unnecessary requests to the database. This can really slow down your server by giving it too much work to do. To investigate what SQL queries are executing on every specific page load, we recommend to use plugin Query Monitor . This plugin allows you to deeply investigate all executed SQL queries during page loading time, its duration, queries callers (which method call the query) and also if there were any duplicate queries which can be eliminated. Query Monitor plugin gives you some more insights information about request processing which may lead you to improve your Wordpress speed and optimize. Also, New Relic may help you to investigate your Wordpress very deeply and uncover bottlenecks, not only with SQL queries. Reduce the amount of operational data The performance of the application and the loading speed can be negatively affected by the growing amount of processed data, both in the database and files on the server. More data in the SQL tables used by the database can prolong the execution of database queries (especially more complex ones), increasing the number of files can lead to higher disk load and more disk operations, which again causes slower application response and server load. We recommend you to regularly delete obsolete articles, old comments under articles, and check the database or files on the server for the accumulation of some temporary data, typically caches, information about logged-in users, access logs, and so on. We also recommend adjusting the settings of plugins that store some temporary data so that they automatically prune it themselves regularly. Disable pingbacks and trackbacks A pingback is an automated comment that gets created when another blog links to you. There can also be self-pingbacks which are created when you link to an article within your own blog. We recommend simply disabling these as they generate worthless queries and additional spam on your site. Remember, the less calls your WordPress site has to make the better, especially on high-traffic sites. Not to mention the fact that a pingback on your own website is just downright annoying. Follow the steps below to disable pingbacks. Disable Pingbacks from other websites: In your WordPress dashboard, click into Settings \u2192 Discussion . Under the Discussion Settings section uncheck the option Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles. Disable Self-Pingbacks: Option to disable Self-Pingbacks is not included in the Wordpress administration interface. You have two options: to use specialized plugin - No Self Pings plugin , or implement the following PHP code into functions.php script in your theme. function wpsites_disable_self_pingbacks( &$links ) { foreach ( $links as $l => $link ) if ( 0 === strpos( $link, get_option( 'home' ) ) ) unset($links[$l]); } add_action( 'pre_ping', 'wpsites_disable_self_pingbacks' ); Limiting Comments and Harmful Bots There is a lot of harmful bots indexing all websites on the internet. The most of them are harmful and causing website overload or post spam comments. If you are not using a comments system on your Wordpress website, disable commenting in Wordpress options to prevent posting spam comments. If you want to use comments in your website, implement CAPTCHA protection to comments forms. There are several plugins which can help you with CAPTCHA or any other antispam protection. In our default servers settings are already implemented some limitations and blockations of well-known bad bots which very often causing websites or servers overloads, so your sites are protected also by our side.","title":"Wordpress"},{"location":"wordpress/#wordpress","text":"WordPress is open source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app. Beautiful designs, powerful features, and the freedom to build anything you want.

So, what are the most common online services to test your website speed? Pingdom Tools - Pingdom Tools rates your site based on several metrics. For instance, it shows how many requests were required, how many redirects were performed, and how your site\u2019s speed compares to others.

These files can include scripts, stylesheets, and images from external resources like Google, Facebook, analytics services, and so on. It\u2019s ok to use a few of these. Many of these files are optimized to load as quickly as possible, so it\u2019s faster than hosting them on your own website. But if your plugins are making a lot of these requests, then it could slow down your website significantly. You can reduce all these external HTTP requests by disabling scripts and styles or merging them into one file. Another problem are calls to different 3rd party API services or any other external resources which your theme or plugins depend on when processing PHP its codes. If such 3rd service or API is unavailable, your website may slow down rapidly or even may cause complete website downtime.","title":"Reduce External HTTP Requests"},{"location":"wordpress/#reduce-database-calls","text":"Unfortunately, there are a lot of poorly coded WordPress themes out there. They ignore WordPress standard practices and end up making direct database calls, or too many unnecessary requests to the database. This can really slow down your server by giving it too much work to do. To investigate what SQL queries are executing on every specific page load, we recommend to use plugin Query Monitor . This plugin allows you to deeply investigate all executed SQL queries during page loading time, its duration, queries callers (which method call the query) and also if there were any duplicate queries which can be eliminated. Query Monitor plugin gives you some more insights information about request processing which may lead you to improve your Wordpress speed and optimize. Also, New Relic may help you to investigate your Wordpress very deeply and uncover bottlenecks, not only with SQL queries.","title":"Reduce Database Calls"},{"location":"wordpress/#reduce-the-amount-of-operational-data","text":"The performance of the application and the loading speed can be negatively affected by the growing amount of processed data, both in the database and files on the server. More data in the SQL tables used by the database can prolong the execution of database queries (especially more complex ones), increasing the number of files can lead to higher disk load and more disk operations, which again causes slower application response and server load. We recommend you to regularly delete obsolete articles, old comments under articles, and check the database or files on the server for the accumulation of some temporary data, typically caches, information about logged-in users, access logs, and so on. We also recommend adjusting the settings of plugins that store some temporary data so that they automatically prune it themselves regularly.","title":"Reduce the amount of operational data"},{"location":"wordpress/#disable-pingbacks-and-trackbacks","text":"A pingback is an automated comment that gets created when another blog links to you. There can also be self-pingbacks which are created when you link to an article within your own blog. We recommend simply disabling these as they generate worthless queries and additional spam on your site. Remember, the less calls your WordPress site has to make the better, especially on high-traffic sites. Not to mention the fact that a pingback on your own website is just downright annoying. Follow the steps below to disable pingbacks. Disable Pingbacks from other websites: In your WordPress dashboard, click into Settings \u2192 Discussion . Under the Discussion Settings section uncheck the option Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles. Disable Self-Pingbacks: Option to disable Self-Pingbacks is not included in the Wordpress administration interface. You have two options: to use specialized plugin - No Self Pings plugin , or implement the following PHP code into functions.php script in your theme. function wpsites_disable_self_pingbacks( &$links ) { foreach ( $links as $l => $link ) if ( 0 === strpos( $link, get_option( 'home' ) ) ) unset($links[$l]); } add_action( 'pre_ping', 'wpsites_disable_self_pingbacks' );","title":"Disable pingbacks and trackbacks"},{"location":"wordpress/#limiting-comments-and-harmful-bots","text":"There is a lot of harmful bots indexing all websites on the internet. The most of them are harmful and causing website overload or post spam comments. If you are not using a comments system on your Wordpress website, disable commenting in Wordpress options to prevent posting spam comments. If you want to use comments in your website, implement CAPTCHA protection to comments forms. There are several plugins which can help you with CAPTCHA or any other antispam protection. In our default servers settings are already implemented some limitations and blockations of well-known bad bots which very often causing websites or servers overloads, so your sites are protected also by our side.","title":"Limiting Comments and Harmful Bots"}]}
